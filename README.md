Setup of basic AR scenes using Unity AR foundation

About the AR Template: The AR Project Template configures project settings for Unity applications that wish to use Augmented Reality.
This Template uses the following Unity features:

### AR Foundation: 
a tool that allows you to work with augmented reality platforms in a multi-platform way within Unity. This package presents an interface for Unity developers to use. For more information see the AR Foundation docs.
Interfaces for the following platforms: `ARCore, ARKit, Hololens, and Magic Leap.`

### XR Management: 
a tool to help streamline XR plug-in lifecycle management and potentially provide users with build time UI through the Unity Unified Settings system. For more information see the XR Management docs.

The template contains the following:

- A sample scene that is already configured for Augmented Reality, including an `AR Session` and `AR Session Origin`.
- Example Assets for an AR Scene all in a single folder that can be easily removed.


## Using the AR Project Template
### Using the sample Scene
The template contains a Scene named SampleScene. This scene contains sample materials and models. It additionally contains all the tutorials, and a script that allows you to spawn anchors through input.

You can use this Scene as a reference, or you can remove the example Assets from it and use it as a starting point for your own Project.

## Use Cases of Augmented Reality
AR has a wide range of applications across various industries. Some common use cases of augmented reality include:

**Gaming:** AR has revolutionized the gaming industry by creating immersive and interactive experiences, allowing users to interact with virtual objects in their real environment.

**Education:** AR is being used in education to provide interactive and engaging learning experiences. It can bring static concepts to life, making it easier for students to understand complex subjects.

**Retail:** AR is used in retail to enhance the shopping experience. It allows customers to try on virtual clothes, visualize furniture in their homes before buying, and even see how products work through virtual demonstrations.

**Healthcare:** AR is being used in healthcare for various purposes, such as surgical training, patient education, and visualization of medical data.

**Architecture and Interior Design:** AR can be used to visualize and present architectural designs, allowing clients to see how a building or interior space will look before construction begins. It enables real-time adjustments and improvements, enhancing the design process.

**Navigation and Wayfinding:** AR can assist users in navigating their surroundings by overlaying directions, points of interest, and real-time information onto their field of view. This technology is particularly useful in complex indoor environments like airports, shopping malls, or museums.

**Virtual Try-On in Retail:** AR enables virtual try-on experiences, allowing customers to visualize how clothing, accessories, or cosmetics will look on them without physically trying them on. This enhances the online shopping experience and reduces returns.
