Setup of basic AR scenes using Unity AR foundation

About the AR Template: The AR Project Template configures project settings for Unity applications that wish to use Augmented Reality.
This Template uses the following Unity features:

### AR Foundation: 
a tool that allows you to work with augmented reality platforms in a multi-platform way within Unity. This package presents an interface for Unity developers to use. For more information see the AR Foundation docs.
Interfaces for the following platforms: `ARCore, ARKit, Hololens, and Magic Leap.`

### XR Management: 
a tool to help streamline XR plug-in lifecycle management and potentially provide users with build time UI through the Unity Unified Settings system. For more information see the XR Management docs.

The template contains the following:

- A sample scene that is already configured for Augmented Reality, including an `AR Session` and `AR Session Origin`.
- Example Assets for an AR Scene all in a single folder that can be easily removed.


## Using the AR Project Template
### Using the sample Scene
The template contains a Scene named SampleScene. This scene contains sample materials and models. It additionally contains all the tutorials, and a script that allows you to spawn anchors through input.

You can use this Scene as a reference, or you can remove the example Assets from it and use it as a starting point for your own Project.
